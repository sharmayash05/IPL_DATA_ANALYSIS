# IPL Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing IPL match data using an ETL pipeline built with PySpark. The primary goal is to extract insights on team and player performance, delivering key metrics through data analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview
The IPL Data Analysis project processes and analyzes match data to identify trends and performance indicators. The workflow involves:

1. **Extracting** raw IPL data from sources like Amazon S3 buckets.
2. **Transforming** the data by cleaning, filtering, and aggregating it using PySpark.
3. **Loading** the processed data into a structured format suitable for analysis.
4. **Analyzing** the data to generate insights, such as top-performing teams, players, and match outcomes.

## Technologies Used
- **PySpark**: For data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL).
- **Databricks**: Development environment and big data processing.
- **SQL**: For data querying and manipulation.
- **Python**: General scripting and data processing.
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas**: Data visualization and analysis.

## Key Features
- ETL pipeline for structured IPL match data.
- Data transformations for trend analysis and performance metrics.
- Visualizations to display team and player insights, including top performers and winning trends.

## How to Run the Project

### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone [repository URL]
```

### Set up the environment:
- Use **Databricks** for running PySpark jobs.
- Ensure necessary libraries such as **pandas**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn** are installed.

### Run the PySpark script:
1. **Load the IPL dataset** into Databricks.
2. **Execute the ETL pipeline** to process the data.
3. Analyze results through SQL queries or visualizations.

## Results
The project provides insights into:
- Team and player performance trends.
- Key metrics such as highest scores, top-performing players, and winning patterns.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporating more advanced **machine learning models** for predictive analysis.
- Expanding data sources to include **player statistics** and historical match data for deeper insights.
